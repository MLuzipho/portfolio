# Portfolio Website ‚Äî [Malungelo Luzipho]

Welcome to my online portfolio! This site showcases my work in Computational Engineering, where I combine fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, and electromagnetics to solve real-world problems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è About the Site

- **Built with**: HTML5, CSS3 (including responsive media queries), vanilla JavaScript.
- **Highlights**:
  - A dynamic, mobile-first layout to ensure an engaging experience on all devices.
  - Image lightbox gallery for detailed viewing of simulation results.
  - Embedded videos illustrating CFD/FEA workflows and results.
  - Smooth scroll-based animations with Intersection Observer.
  - A visually appealing animated particle background built with Canvas.

## üìÅ Site Structure

- `/index.html`: Home page with introduction and featured projects.
- `/assets/`: Contains fonts, images, videos, and raw simulation data.
- `/style.css`: Defines the page layout, animations, galleries, and responsive behavior.
- `/script.js`: Implements canvas animation, scroll-triggered reveals, lightbox behavior, and mobile video handling.

## üß™ Technical Details

- **Canvas Animation**: Custom particle system driven by `requestAnimationFrame` to add interactive visual interest.
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts through flexible containers and media queries.
- **Lightbox Gallery**: Click image thumbnails to open modal-style enlarged views.
- **Video Embeds**: Autoplaying, muted, and inline playback for a smooth mobile experience.
- **Scroll Animations**: Paragraphs and lists animate into view using the IntersectionObserver API.

### ‚úÖ Tips to Tailor Further

1. **Show off your strongest project(s)** ‚Äî describe tools like ANSYS Fluent, SpaceClaim, OpenFOAM, COMSOL, or Python scripts you used.
2. **Highlight key metrics** ‚Äî how many simulations ran, speedups achieved, accuracy improvements, etc.
3. **Explain your design decisions** ‚Äî why choose lightbox gallery or canvas background.
4. **Add quick live screenshots** ‚Äî embed small preview images in your README.
5. **Link to your GitHub Pages** so visitors can click through directly.
